General Information
===================

.. note::
    - SG13S is a high performance BiCMOS technology with a 0.13 µm CMOS process. It contains bipolar devices based on SiGe:C npn-HBT's with up to 250 GHz transit frequency (fT) and 300 GHz maximum oscillation frequency. 
    
    - This process provides 2 gate oxides: A thin gate oxide for the 1.2 V digital logic and a thick oxide for a 3.3 V supply voltage. For both modules NMOS, PMOS and isolated NMOS transistors are offered. Further passive components like poly silicon resistors and MIM capacitors are available. 
    
    - The backend option offers 5 thin Al metal layers, two thick Al metal layers (2 and 3 µm thick)and a MIM layer.

    - SG13G2 has the same device portfolio as SG13S but much higher bipolar performance with f T = 300 GHz and 500 GHz maximum oscillation frequency.
