.. warning::
   IHP Open Source PDK are currently treating the current content as an **experimental preview** / **alpha release**.

While the SG13G2 process node and the PDK from which this open source release was derived have been 
used to create many designs that have been successfully manufactured in significant quantities, 
the open source PDK is not intended to be used for production at this moment.

The PDK will be tagged with a production version when ready to do production design.
