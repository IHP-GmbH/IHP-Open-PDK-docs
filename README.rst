==================================

.. current_status_text

.. warning::
   IHP Open Source PDK are currently treating the current content as an **experimental preview** / **alpha release**.

While the SG13G2 process node and the PDK from which this open source release was derived have been 
used to create many designs that have been successfully manufactured in significant quantities, 
the open source PDK is not intended to be used for production at this moment.

The PDK will be tagged with a production version when ready to do production design.

SG13G2 Process Node
=====================

SG13G2 is a high performance BiCMOS technology with a 0.13 μm CMOS process. It contains bipolar
devices based on SiGe:C npn-HBT's with up to 350 GHz transient frequency ($f_T$) and 450 GHz oscillation
frequency ($f_{max}$). This process provides 2 gate oxides: A thin gate oxide for the 1.2 V digital logic and a thick
oxide for a 3.3 V supply voltage. For both modules NMOS, PMOS and isolated NMOS transistors are
offered. Further passive components like poly silicon resistors and MIM capacitors are available. The
backend option offers 5 thin metal layers, two thick metal layers (2 and 3 μm thick) and a MIM layer.

Prerequisites
=============

At a minimum:

-  Git 2.35+
-  Python 3.6+

On Ubuntu, simply
------------------

``apt install -y build-essential virtualenv python3``

Building the documentation
==========================

To build documentation locally, you could use the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   # Download the repository
   git clone https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK
   cd docs/

   # Create a Python virtual environment and install requirements into it.
   virtualenv docs_env --python=python3
   . docs_env/bin/activate

   # Build the documentation
   make docs

About IHP
=========

**The IHP is a non-university research establishment institutionally funded by the German federal and state governments and a member of the Leibniz Association.**

The IHP is one of the world's leading research institutions in the field of silicon/germanium electronics. In this field, it has extensive, closely coordinated expertise in semiconductor technology, materials research, high-frequency circuit design and system solutions. Its electronic and photonic-electronic technologies and circuits are among the most powerful in the world. In the speed of silicon-based transistors, IHP holds the world record with 720 GHz maximum oscillation frequency. The institute has a pilot line that manufactures circuits using its high-performance SiGe BiCMOS technologies. Through its research and manufacturing services, IHP contributes significantly to the innovative strength of Germany and Europe, especially in the field of ultrahigh-frequency electronics. The institute's research results are applied in socially important areas such as semiconductor manufacturing, wireless and power broadband communications, health, space, Industry 4.0 or Agriculture 4.0 and mobility.
